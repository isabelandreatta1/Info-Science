1. What did we **do**? 

We did an activity where we were supposed to create instruction on ‘how to make a jam sandwich’. During this activity, we had to be concise and specific, especially regarding the location and with defining certain actions. For example, stating “take a piece of bread” was not sufficient, we would have to specify by stating “reach for the plastic bag and place it on your left hand. Using your right  hand, untwist the top and then grab a slice of bread.” 

1. What did we **learn**? 


We learnt and developed our computational thinking skills.  In the first half of the class, we learnt about computational skills and the different layers of it: decomposition (breaking down the issue), pattern recognition (how can we apply previous successes to this issue), abstraction (isolating the issue), algorithmic thinking (creating set of simple rules to fix this issue). We were presented with a task which was quite open ended and involved a lot of trial and error, and therefore, had to apply these thinking skills to succeed. First of all, knowing the criterion of being concise, we wrote instruction based on what we thought would work. Then, we tested them out by giving them to Dr. Ruben. Once the instructions didn’t work, we had to isolate the issue and modify it. We also looked at the other groups’ and observed how they succeed and failed, and tried to apply that to our instructions. As the last step, we had to write clear instructions so as it would be easily understood by someone else (or a computer). We repeated this process up until we had to an algorithm (set of rules) which succeed in created a sandwich. 

1. What **questions** do I have? 


How long does it take to retain and learn a programming language? How and why do programming language differ? How does one create a separate programming language?  What type of projects will we be creating? What are the limits to coding? How do you simplify code? Once we create a code, what does each individual text mean/have an impact on?
