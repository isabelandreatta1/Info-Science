**What did we do?**


This week we learnt about cryptography by first, watching a few videos, and then we were introduced the Caesar Cipher. The Caesar cipher is one of the oldest and, historically, most used, which functions very simply. A cipher is a list of rules that the are used to encode your message, while the key tells you how to use the rules. The key is important because without variation, it would be easy to decrypt the code. For the Caesar cipher, the cipher (the rule) is based on shifting the alphabet by x spaces. The key would tell you by how many spaces is it shifted by, therefore helping you decrypt the message. We also learnt the different methods of decrypting the Caesar cipher (which is a monoalphabetic cipher): trying every possible combination and frequency analysis. Once we understood this, we had to encrypt two codes which used the Caesar cipher. The first was a riddle while the second one was a YouTube link. With the YouTube link, we learnt about Cicada 3301. Cicada 3301 is a mysterious organisation who uploaded a long chain of codes on 4chan. They gained mass following due to both the secrecy of the organisation as well as the difficulty of these puzzles. We also learnt about the enigma machine which was was used in WWII by Germany. The way the engima machine worked was by randomly assigning shifts for each letter. The only way to decrypt the code was to have the same machine, at least in principle. The Allies were able to decrypt it due the fact that, first of all, the Germans kept repeating common passwords, but also that an input letter could never output itself. The last task we had was to create our own cipher and compare that to the Ceaser cipher. As I did not have cardboard nor a printer, I ended up making a much more simpler cipher than the enigma (unfortunately), and made a playfair cipher. I created two versions, the first is just inputting the alphabet in order, and the second one I used the word "exist" first to mix the order up.

**Cicada 3301**


Cicada 3301's puzzles all had complicated tasks, however, generally followed a similar pattern in terms of where they hi their clues. Firstly, the would have a message that could be found from the original image posted. In the first puzzle, they took the dimmensions of the image and put it into a link. From then, there would be a mixture of different puzzles. These would be, for example, finding the coordinated to  posters in different international locations. They also hid clues within riddles, and even used a song. The most common and repetative thread that Cicada 3301 was by putting their messages inside of books. Many clues were written down in Cicada's book, Liber Primus, which was written in runes.
