**What conclusion can you draw from the simulations you run in step 3. Explain.**


**Propose another table of simulations. Variables we can change include: population size, distance of infection, movement size, number of people moving.** 


**What did we do**


In this assignment, we had to do three major tasks. The first task was to practice and further understand for loop, this helps us with repeating a sequence. This task was further divided into the three smaller tasks: a program that prints 100 bears (1-100), a program that counts the years from 1900-2000 and a program that prints the conversion from celsius to farenheit (from 0 - 100 C). The second task we had to complete was to figure out how to add a bargraph that shows the number of people infected and the number of those healthy, the bar graph had to include numbers. We also had to add a counter for how many times the simulation has ran, or the iteration number. The final task was to fill out a table which included five different runs of the simulation and recording number of people moving and number of iterations until all population is infected. 

**What we learnt**

**What questions do I have** 

1. Code for bear 
```py 
#repeat 100 times
for b in range(101):
    print'bears',(b) #1,2,3,4...100 
    
``` 
2. Code for year 
```py
for b in range(1900,2001):
    print'The year is',(b) #1,2,3,4...100 
```
3. Code for Celsius to Farenheit 
```py 
for c in range(100):
    f = c * 1.8 + 32 #formula, had to change 9/5 from fraction to decimal 
    print c,'C are','F', f
```
4. Code for coronavirus simulation & bar graph/counting roll 
```py 


```
